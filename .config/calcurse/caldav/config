# If you want to synchronize calcurse with a CalDAV server using
# calcurse-caldav, create a new directory ~/.calcurse/caldav/, copy this file
# to ~/.calcurse/caldav/config and adjust the configuration below.

[General]
# Path to the calcurse binary that is used for importing/exporting items.
Binary = calcurse

# Host name of the server that hosts CalDAV.
Hostname = drive.yigitcolakoglu.com

# Path to the CalDAV calendar on the host specified above.
Path = remote.php/dav/calendars/yigitcolakoglu/pcalendar

# Type of authentication to use. Must be "basic" or "oauth2"
AuthMethod = basic

# Enable this if you want to skip SSL certificate checks.
InsecureSSL = No

# Disable this if you want to use HTTP instead of HTTPS.
# Using plain HTTP is highly discouraged.
HTTPS = Yes

# This option allows you to filter the types of tasks synced. To this end, the
# value of this option should be a comma-separated list of item types, where
# each item type is either "event", "apt", "recur-event", "recur-apt", "todo",
# "recur" or "cal". Note that the comma-separated list must not contain any
# spaces. Refer to the documentation of the --filter-type command line argument
# of calcurse for more details. Set this option to "cal" if the configured
# CalDAV server doesn't support tasks, such as is the case with Google
# Calendar.
SyncFilter = cal,todo,recur,recur-event,event

# Disable this option to actually enable synchronization. If it is enabled,
# nothing is actually written to the server or to the local data files. If you
# combine DryRun = Yes with Verbose = Yes, you get a log of what would have
# happened with this option disabled.
DryRun = No

# Enable this if you want detailed logs written to stdout.
Verbose = Yes

# Credentials for HTTP Basic Authentication. Leave this commented out if you do
# not want to use authentication.

# Scope of access for API calls. Synchronization requires read/write.
