# Invoked by a herdr keybind as: navigate.sh <left|down|up|right>
#
# If the focused pane is running Vim/Neovim in the foreground, hand the matching
# Ctrl chord to that pane so Vim moves between its own splits (and, at a split
# edge, calls back into herdr to cross the pane boundary — see editor/*). The same
# forwarding can be turned on for other TUIs that own Ctrl+h/j/k/l themselves via
# HERDR_NAV_PASSTHROUGH_RE (off by default — see below). For any other foreground
# process, move herdr's pane focus directly.
#
# Requires `jq`. Without it, detection is skipped and every key just moves the
# herdr pane focus (no Vim awareness).
