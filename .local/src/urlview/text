This is a test message which contains some examples of URLs commonly found
in email messages.

X-Url: http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~me

<a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu">Harvey Mudd College Home Page</a>

<a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu">Harvey Mudd College Home Page</a>

mailto:me@cs.hmc.edu	some other random text

Please see the Mutt Home Page at http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~me/mutt, or
its mirror site http://www.mutt.org.

Sometimes we also see things like www.gnustep.org, or
www.windowmaker.org/features.html all by itself with no http or ftp.

www.m-w.com is a good internet dictionary.

Also "strange" urls like www3.google.com are now supported.

ftp://ftp.fooboo.com
Ftp urls without protocol, like ftp.debian.org, are recognized.

ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/u/urlview/urlview_0.9-6_i386.deb

Since urlview-0.9-11 we are also able to manage correctly RFC 2368 urls 
(mailto URL scheme). For instance:
<mailto:infobot@example.com?body=send%20current-issue>
