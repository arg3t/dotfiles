<sect1>NAME
<p>
urlview - URL extractor/launcher

<sect1>SYNOPSIS
<p>
urlview &lt;filename&gt; &lsqb; &lt;filename&gt; ... &rsqb;

<sect1>DESCRIPTION
<p>
<em/urlview/ is a screen oriented program for extracting URLs from text
files and displaying a menu from which you may launch a command to view a
specific item.

<sect1>CONFIGURATION
<p>
<em/urlview/ attempts to read <em>&tilde;/.urlview</em> upon startup.
If this file doesn't exist, it will try to read a system wide file 
in <em>/etc/urlview/system.urlview</em>. There are
two configuration commands (order does not matter):
<p>
REGEXP &lt;regular expression to use for URL matching&gt;
<p>

<em/urlview/ uses a regular expression to extract URLs from the specified
text files.  &bsol;r, &bsol;t, &bsol;n and &bsol;f are all converted to
their normal printf(2) meanings.  The default REGEXP is

<verb>
(((http|https|ftp|gopher)|mailto):(//)?[^ <>"\t]*|(www|ftp)[0-9]?\.[-a-z0-9.]+)[^ .,;\t\n\r<">\):]?[^, <>"\t]*[^ .,;\t\n\r<">\):]
</verb>

<p>
COMMAND &lt;command to launch with URL&gt;
<p>
If the specified command contains a ``&percnt;s'', it will be subsituted
with the URL that was requested, otherwise the URL is appended to the
COMMAND string.  The default COMMAND is
<verb>
	url_handler.sh '%s'
</verb>
another possibility would be
<verb>
	Netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)'
</verb>
<bf/NOTE:/ you should always put single quotes ('') around usage of
``&percnt;s'' and never let the REGEXP to match any string containing
a single quote (note <tt/&lsqb;&caret;&apos;...&rsqb;/ in the default REGEXP)
to avoid characters in the selected URL from being interpreted
by your shell.  For example, I could put the following URL in my email
messages:
<verb>
	X-Nasty-Url: http://www.`program_to_execute_as_you`.com
</verb>
If you pass this URL to your shell, it could have nasty consequences.

<p>
QUITONLAUNCH
<p>
Will cause urlview to quit after you launch a URL.

<sect1>FILES
<p>
<descrip>
<tag>
/etc/urlview/system.urlview
<p>
system-wide urlview configuration file
<tag>
&tilde;/.urlview
<p>
urlview configuration file
</descrip>

<sect1>ENVIRONMENT
<p>
If the environment variable BROWSER is set to a browser command, or a
colon-delimited list of commands to try, then the specified browser is
used. %s is replaced with the quoted url to view. If %s is not part of a
command, the url is appended to the command.
<p>
The BROWSER environment variable is honored only if the rc-file doesn't 
contain the COMMAND option.
The rc-file provided by the Debian package contains a COMMAND option.
